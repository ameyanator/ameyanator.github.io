Inspired by the [100DaysOfCode][2] Challenge I have decided to take on this challenge. For the next 100 Days, I'll spend some time exercising on will work on improving my upper body strength. Follow my progress on [Twitter][3] and on this blog.

### Day 1: December 13, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jogged around the cricket round twice.     

**Thoughts:** To start something is really hard. I absolutely did not feel like getting up and going to the cricket ground at all! Still managed to force myself out of the bed make jog two rounds. Hopefully will get better in the coming days.
