Inspired by the [100DaysOfCode][2] Challenge I have decided to take on this challenge. For the next 100 Days, I'll spend some time exercising on will work on improving my upper body strength. Follow my progress on [Twitter][3] and on this blog.

### Day 1: January 9, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Jogged around the cricket round thrice in the evening and ran for about 15 mins in the morning. 10 pushups in the afternoon.

**Thoughts:** I find myself comfortable with running and need to develop stamina to continue running for longer periods of time. However, I need to work on my upper body strength.
